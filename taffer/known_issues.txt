Known bugs in the default game regarding the graphics are listed below. All of
them can be fixed by editing data/init/init.txt and setting GRAPHICS to NO.

  • Goblins, elves, humans, and kobolds that are dead, out of sight in
    adventure mode, or carved on walls will still look like their default
    letters.
  • All historical figures in adventure mode—including your character—blink
    blue.
  • The status screen in dwarf fortress mode shows the same icon for both
    regular and soldier dwarves.
