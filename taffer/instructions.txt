Copy the data and raw folders over your Dwarf Fortress installation,
overwriting any contents. If you have a saved game you need to copy the raw
folder inside of data/save/<yoursave>, overwriting the contents again. If you
want the racial graphics disabled—perhaps you're using one of the “dwarf
letters” variants—then open up your data/init/init file and replace
[GRAPHICS:YES] with [GRAPHICS:NO].

This set will also work fine with almost any mod, provided it is intended for
“ASCII” graphics.

Don't try to install on top of a different graphics set.
